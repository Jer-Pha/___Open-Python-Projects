lvl 5 Query for number or name

Create a python rolodex (rolodex{name}.py) that reads "name_number.txt".
Users should be able to query the name_number.txt by name or number for an output of the corresponding number or name; users can query by name or number; output in either case should be the full name and number. Also allow user to 'quit'.

name_number.txt is located in this repo

Also, make a specification outlining:
• code method/design
• what data structure(s) to use
• assumptions

To submit your solution, create a local branch and push it:
open Github Desktop (GD)..   Clone repo via ⇧ ⌘ O   -  or file > clone repo  
select URL option, enter https://github.com/drakeredwind01/___Open-Python-Projects.git
click 'clone' if needed -- it will download to Github desktop
create branch..  select 'Current Branch main' at top..   '+ New Branch'..   
  select new branch button..  name it..  click 'Create' button.. 
you will have the option to open the repo in your IDE
code your solution or changes in your IDE
name your file: 	feature/project_rolodex/rolodex_{name}.py
      {name}; something like your real name or user_name
take your file and drag it to the rolodex directory in GD..  click 'Refactor' button.. 
  make a copy if you still want to retain it where it is, otherwise you will just move your file to GD
create a 'Changes' file: click on each file to upload, right click, select git, select + add
  this places your file(s) in the 'Changes' folder; this will show up when you 'Commit'

Commit  
⌘ O  or click second icon down on top left; looks like -o-
click the 'Changes' folder box, or select the files to load
there may also be many files in a 'Unversioned files' folder which you do not need to load
  if it contains a file you wish to load, follow the 'Changes' procedure
write a commit message
click 'commit and push' button
you will be asked to login to GitHub
click 'push' button   --if you get: 'push failed?'..  ref. below

issue has to do with credential caching, or perhaps your OS is too old
fix: instal the GitHub CLI  --aka. gh      --and/or perhaps you need a newer OS
  ref. https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/gh-command-not-found
  on a mac: $ brew install gh   then..   $ gh auth login   then..  $ gh --version   to verify it works
  now try to push your file(s) again   -- ⇧ ⌘ K   on a mac
