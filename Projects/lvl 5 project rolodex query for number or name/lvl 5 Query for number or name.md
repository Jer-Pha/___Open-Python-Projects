# lvl 5 Query for number or name
last updated: April 13, 2024

Create a python rolodex (rolodex{name}.py) that reads "name_number.txt".<br>
Users should be able to query the name_number.txt document by name or number for an output of the corresponding number or name; output in either case should be the full name and number. <br>
Also allow user to 'quit'. The name_number.txt document is located in this directory.<br>
Bonus: a lesson of how to make a commit; if you need it.

This is a continuation of 'project 'lvl 4 project rolodex'..  but of course you can start here.
