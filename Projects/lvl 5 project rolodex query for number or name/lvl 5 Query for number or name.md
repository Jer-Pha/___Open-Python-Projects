# lvl 5 Query for number or name
last updated: April 13, 2024

Create a python rolodex (rolodex{name}.py) that reads "name_number.txt".
Users should be able to query the name_number.txt document by name or number for an output of the corresponding number or name; users can query by name or number; output in either case should be the full name and number. Also allow user to 'quit'. The name_number.txt document is located in this directory.

This is a continuation of 'project 'lvl 4 project rolodex'..  but of course u can start here.
